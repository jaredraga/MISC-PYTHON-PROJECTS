# Hangman Game

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game, where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word.

## Features
- **Single Player Mode**: Play against the computer to guess the hidden word.
- **Word List**: The game randomly selects words from a predefined list.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the number of incorrect guesses and displays the current state of the word.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple console-based interface for easy interaction.

## Functionality
1. **Game Initialization**: The game starts by randomly selecting a word from the word list.
2. **Letter Guessing**: Players can guess letters one at a time. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed.
3. **Win/Loss Conditions**: The game ends when the player either guesses the word or exhausts the maximum number of incorrect guesses.
4. **Replay Option**: After finishing a game, players can choose to play again.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the `hangman.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage
Run the game using the command:
```bash
python hangman.py
```
This will start the game in the console, where you can begin guessing letters.
