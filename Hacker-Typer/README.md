# Hacker Typer

This project simulates a typing experience similar to what is seen in movies, where characters appear to be typing code at high speed.

## Features
- **Realistic Typing Simulation**: Mimics the appearance of coding with random text appearing on the screen as if being typed.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can adjust the typing speed and the text that is displayed.

## Functionality
1. **Typing Simulation**: The script generates random code snippets or text that appears to be typed out in real-time.
2. **User Interaction**: Users can start and stop the typing simulation at will.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the `HackerTyper.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage
Run the script using the command:
```bash
python HackerTyper.py
```
This will start the typing simulation.
